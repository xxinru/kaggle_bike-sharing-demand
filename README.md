+ competition url: https://pse.is/3rryf8

### Competition Description:
Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city.

### The competition goal:
To predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.

### Prediction step:
1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
2. Feature Engineering
    + Outliers Detection
    + Feature Transformation
    + Missing Value Imputation
3. Build machine learning models
    + Linear regression
    + Polynomial regression
    + RandomForest regressor
4. Choose model and predict
